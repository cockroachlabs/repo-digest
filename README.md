## repo-digest

generate daily digests of repository activity

### Synopsis



Generate an HTML digest of repository activity (default stylesheet
included). The digest includes two sections: a list of all newly-open
pull requests as well as a list of all recently-committed pull
requests.

Fetches GitHub data for the specified repository and computes the digest
since the --since date. The digest contains two sections including:

Each pull request includes basic information, including title, author,
date, and metrics about which subdirectories of the repository are
most affected.

Pull requests are ordered by total modification size (additions +
deletions).

An access token can be specified via --token. By default, uses an empty
token, which is limited to only 50 GitHub requests per hour, rate limited
based on IP address.

To generate an access token with authorized rate limits (5000/hr), see:

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/

When creating a token, ensure that only the public_repo permission is enabled.
